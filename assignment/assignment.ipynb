    "1. This paper focuses on an aspect of data cleaning known as data tidying, which is a way of organizing data in a structured, tabular format. This process makes it easier to deal with messy data without the need for complex tools, as well as allows for more efficient data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.\n",
    "2. The tidy data standard makes initial data cleaning easier by preventing the \"need to start from scratch.\" By providing a standard, consistent structure for organizing datasets, as well as a set of data analysis tools that work well together, it simplifies the initial exploration and analysis processes, allowing data analysts to focus on meaningful analysis rather than the logistics of the data.\n",
    "3. The first sentence, \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way,\" is trying to reiterate the author's message that all tidy datasets follow a consistent structure, where each variable is a column and each observation is a row. In contrast, messy datasets can vary widely in how they are messy or disorganized; every messy dataset comes with its own unique structure and challenges. The second sentence, \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general,\" means that when looking at a particular dataset, we can identify the observations by looking at the values in rows and the variables by looking at the columns. However, it is more difficult to broadly define observations or variables because different data require different types (e.g. quantitative or qualitative variables) and structures.\n",
    "4. Values: A dataset is a collection of values, or individual pieces of data, which are usually either numbers or strings. Variables: A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. Observations: An observation contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
    "5. Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. Each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
    "6. The five most common problems with messy datasets: 1) column headers are values, not variable names, 2) multiple variables are stored in one column, 3) variables are stored in both rows and columns, 4) multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, 5) a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. Table 4 is messy because the column headers are values that really represent the variable 'income'. This violates the tidy principle that each variable should have its own column. Melting a dataset is a way of tidying a dataset by turning columns into rows.\n",
    "7. Table 11 is messy because it has multiple columns, i.e. d1-d8, that represent a single variable 'date'. Table 12a is molten because the date is now a single column. Table 12b is tidy because the element is split into separate variables with their respective values, and therefore, each variable is its own column and each row is a single observation.\n",
    "8. The chicken-and-egg problem posits that tidy data is only as useful as the tools designed to manipulate it, meanwhile, tidy tools are built specifically for tidy data. This makes it easy to get stuck in a \"local maxima\" where changing data structures or tools will not improve workflow. The author hopes to see the field of research in data tidying grow to design more tools for data wrangling that optimize performance and usage. He suggests looking at human-computer interaction, cognitive sciences, multidimensional arrays, etc."

    "3. Please provide a constructive criticism of how the Census was conducted: What was done well? What do you think was missing? How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
